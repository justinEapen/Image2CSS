# Image2CSS
Simple tool that converts Images to pure css files.
## How does it work?


- *Pure CSS*: This output was created by resizing and setting each pixel as a box-shadow of a single pixel div, so no `img` tag or `background-image` is needed. This can result in huge outputs, and the use of this output is not recommended for production.
